### Introduction

Welcome to my eternal side project! Started in 2017 as a web dev bootcamp student, it lives on as progressive repository to learn more about software engineering as well as a tool to revisit my academic roots in math, physics and astronomy.

ExtraSolar is a simplistic visualization tool that roughly plots the orbital structures of known exoplanets. The actual data used is pulled from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
