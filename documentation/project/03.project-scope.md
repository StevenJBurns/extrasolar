### What are we building?

The root challenge is the rough mapping and analyzing exoplanets, planets beyond our own solar system. using NASA data, we aim to:

- measure cosmic phenomena with relative precision.
- model relationships between stars, planets, and orbits.
- turn raw data into a meaningful visualization.

### Core Concepts

Below are the building block entities of our domain:

- **solar systems**: collections of stars and their orbiting planets, modeling cosmic 
- **stars**: the 
- **exoplanets**: distant worlds orbiting other stars, pulled from NASA’s exoplanet archive.
- **moons**: more of a placeholder since no planetary moons have been discovered outside our solar system

As an exercise in math and science, the project requires some mathematical and astrophysics values to compliment the entities:
- **angles**: orientation measurements (degrees or radians) for orbits, trajectories, and more—see `Angle.convert.ts`.
structures.
- **distance and length**: the process of transforming data into insights—finding patterns, identifying new exoplanets.
- **coordinate**: coming soon
- **luminosity**: coming soon
- **temperature**: coming soon
- **time**: coming soon
- **mass**: coming soon
- **orbits**: paths of planets around stars, calculated with angles and distances.


### Why this matters

exoplanets are a window into the universe’s vastness. by measuring angles, mapping orbits, and modeling solar systems, we can better understand where these worlds fit in the cosmos—and maybe even find signs of life.

this domain sets the stage for everything we build—our tools, calculations, and discoveries all flow from here.
